# Overbond - Coding Challenge

  * To view, simply clone the repo and open `index.html`. This uses the precompiled JavaScript from `dist`.
  * To compile:
    1. Make sure the latest versions of Node.js and npm are installed
    2. Clone the repo
    3. In the repo directory, run `npm install`.
    4. Compile the JavaScript by running `./node_modules/.bin/webpack --config webpack.config.js`. This will recomple the JavaScript package in `dist`.
  
Packages used:
  * webpack (CommonJS)
  * Node.js/npm (ES2015 and JSX compiling)
  * Bootstrap (styling)
  * Font Awesome (chart icon; note that I couldn't locate the exact icon as in the image)
  * React.js
